Be sure to check whether your number range is correct 
â€“ the challenge asks us to negate all numbers from 0 to 9. 
This can be done using the negate caret placed immediately after the first opening bracket of your regexp.

let numbersRegExp = /[^0-9]/gi;

let quoteSample = "3 blind mice.";
let myRegex = /[^aeiou^0-9]/gi; // 
let result = quoteSample.match(myRegex); //
