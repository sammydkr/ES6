Any letter in a regex expression that is followed by a * does not have to occur 
in the string tested whereas any letter in a regex expression followed by a + must occur in a string at least once, as shown below,

let phrase = "ba humbug";

let regexPlus = /bah+/;
let regexStar = /bah*/;

regexPlus.test(phrase); // returns false
regexStar.test(phrase); // returns true
Both allow for any number of occurrences of the letter Ä±n row for example 

let phrase = "wooooow look at that!";

let regexPlus = /wo+w/;
let regexStar = /wo*w/;

regexPlus.test(phrase); // returns true
regexStar.test(phrase); // returns true
For this challenge, chewieQuote has been initialized as the string Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh! 
behind the scenes. Create a regex chewieRegex that uses the * character to match an uppercase 
A character immediately followed by zero or more lowercase a characters in chewieQuote. 
Your regex does not need flags or character classes, and it should not match any of the other quotes.


let chewieQuote = "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!";
let chewieRegex = /Aa*/; // Change this line
let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
