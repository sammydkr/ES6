Fix the regex /<.*>/ to return the HTML tag <h1> and not the text "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>". 
Remember the wildcard . in a regular expression matches any character.

you can use the ? character to change it to lazy matching. 
"titanic" matched against the adjusted regex of /t[a-z]*?i/ returns ["ti"].

let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
let myRegex = /<.*?>/; 
let result = text.match(myRegex);
