For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string ah, your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.

let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4);
multipleA.test(A2);

let ohStr = "Ohhh no";
let ohRegex = /Oh{3,6}\sno/;
let result = ohRegex.test(ohStr);

The first test call would return true, whÄ±le second would return false 


Remember to use \s after Oh{3,6} to include a white space, 
followed by no to pass all test cases. All test cases are written using a capital O, however the testcases could also be passed by using ignore-case : /oh{3,6}\sno/i
