let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 
The obj.review and obj.newProp assignments will result in errors, because our editor runs in strict mode by default, and the console will display the value { name: "FreeCodeCamp", review: "Awesome" }.

We are going to use Object.freeze to prevent mathematical constants from changing. 
We need to freeze the MATH_CONSTANTS object so that no one is able to alter the value of PI, add, or delete properties.
function freezeObj() {
  const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
    PI: 3.14
  };
  Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS);
  


  
  try {
    MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
  } catch(ex) {
    console.log(ex);
  }
  return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
}
const PI = freezeObj();
