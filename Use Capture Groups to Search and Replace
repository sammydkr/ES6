You can search and replace text in a string using .replace() on a string. The inputs for .replace() is first the regex pattern you want to search for. 
The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.

let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");

You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with dollar signs ($).

"Code Camp".replace(/(\w+)\s(\w+)/, '$2 $1');

let str = "one two three";
let fixRegex = /(\w+)\s(\w+)\s(\w+)/;
let replaceText = "$3 $2 $1"; 
let result = str.replace(fixRegex, replaceText);
